## Project Overview

This SQL file contains a series of queries that demonstrate fundamental database operations. The project begins with importing data from a CSV file and progresses through creating a database, defining tables, and performing basic operations such as inserting, updating, and querying data. This project serves as a hands-on practice for mastering SQL basics.

Additionally, I have practiced 20 SQL questions from a preferred practice book, which helped reinforce the concepts and techniques used in this project.

## Data Source

The data used in this project has been downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Kaggle offers a wide range of datasets for various domains, and the data chosen here provides a practical example for learning and applying SQL operations.

## Practice Book

I referred to the [Practice Writing SQL Queries Using Real Dataset](https://techtfq.com/blog/practice-writing-sql-queries-using-real-dataset#google_vignette) by TechTFQ, completing 20 questions from the book. The book covers various topics essential for SQL proficiency, including:

- **Basic SQL Queries**: SELECT statements, filtering, and sorting.
- **Aggregations and Grouping**: Using aggregate functions and GROUP BY clauses.
- **Joins**: Understanding different types of joins to combine data from multiple tables.
- **Subqueries**: Writing nested queries to perform more complex data retrieval.
- **Window Functions**: Implementing window functions like ROW_NUMBER, RANK, and PARTITION BY.
- **String Functions**: Manipulating text data using string functions.
- **Date Functions**: Working with dates and times in SQL.
- **Data Manipulation**: Inserting, updating, and deleting records in a database.
- **Analytical Queries**: Writing queries that involve analytical functions and complex calculations.

## Project Contents

### 1. Importing Data
- **CSV Import**: The project begins by importing data from a CSV file into the database.

### 2. Database Creation
- **Database Creation**: The first step involves creating a new database to hold the tables and data for the project.

### 3. Table Creation
- **Table Definitions**: Tables are defined with the appropriate schema, including column names, data types, primary keys, and other constraints.

### 4. Data Operations
- **Inserting Data**: The data from the CSV file is inserted into the tables.
- **Updating Data**: Queries demonstrate how to update existing records in the tables.
- **Deleting Data**: Examples of deleting records based on specific conditions.
- **Querying Data**: A variety of SELECT queries to retrieve and manipulate the data.

### 5. Additional Operations
- **Joins**: Demonstrates the use of various types of joins to combine data from multiple tables.
- **Aggregations**: Queries include aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc., to perform calculations on the data.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Examples show how to filter data using WHERE clauses and sort results with ORDER BY.

## How to Use

1. **Setup the Database**: Run the provided SQL script to set up the database and tables.
2. **Import Data**: Ensure the CSV file is correctly referenced and imported into the database.
3. **Execute Queries**: Run the SQL queries in the order they appear to replicate the operations and learn from the examples provided.

## Prerequisites

- A working installation of a SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).
- Basic understanding of SQL and database concepts.
